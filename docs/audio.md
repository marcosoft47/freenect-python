# Audio

Kinect's audio is quite impressive. It uses an array of four microphones to reduce ambient noise. It also can get audio from quite a distance.

From my tests, it can capture audio from more than 10 meters easily (as long as you talk normally). This is useful to record a room since  

## Linux

Aparently, the Kinect works fine as a microphone in Linux. My system (Fedora 40 and Ubuntu 24.04) doesn't recognize the microphone. It may be troublesome because it's actually four microphones in a trench coat.

If you managed to make it work, please contact me!

## Coding
The python wrapper doesn't support audio (yet!)

You can use it as a microphone (if you manage to make it work as one)
